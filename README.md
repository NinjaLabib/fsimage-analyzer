# fsimage-analyzer

These scripts are based on code written by Peter Ebert for the fsimage analyzer

The script has been migrated to Pyspark with features to create HDFS directories and tables through the shell script to make it convenient to track fsimage periodically

Usage:

Keep both files in the same directory on an edge node
Run: sh Step1_FetchFsimage.sh
